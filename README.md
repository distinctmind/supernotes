Ever since Evernote has stopped offering their beautiful free tier, I have been searching for a way to write my thoughts down.

Initially this idea was to create an app where I could write my instagram captions and copy them from the app.\
But it has evolved to an app where I can simply write and store my thoughts down.\
For now, it stores on local storage, which isn't ideal if I really care about storing the notes, because local storage is not full proof.\
\
But so far, it is the best evolution of the app. There is much improvement to be made.\
The cool thing is that I actually use my own app everyday, which is the goal, for it to be useful.

Next steps would be to improve the UI/UX, and store notes on some cloud service, would need to implement login at that point.\
Perhaps, could have options for people who don't want to login, thus only use local storage, and for those that want cloud, can login with their email.
